Welcome to the Dreaming of Models blog. This blog was was dreamt up after a long night of learning the basics of Ruby on Rails Models.  My name is Oscar Cisneros Jr and in this blog I plan to chronicle my journey from completing the [ACLTC Development Bootcamp]( http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/) to landing my first developer job. Thank you for joining me on my journey.
