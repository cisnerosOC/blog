Well getting this blog up took a little longer than expected. They told me that setting upon a blog Jekyll would be a bit difficult. All I heard was **“CHALLENGE”** and my response was naturally  **“CHALLENGE ACCEPTED”**.  There were times where it felt like I might have bitten off a bit more than I could chew, but here we are. The blog is up and here is my first blog post.  Finally!

Welcome, my name is Oscar Cisneros Jr. I currently a student in the [Any Can Learn to Code](http://www.anyonecanlearntocode.com) Dev Bootcamp. I am currently in the eighth week of the twelve-week course. We are starting to hit the home stretch. I plan to get in to what I learned over the last couple of weeks in later post but for now I want to share with you how I got here.  My origin story if you will.

For now I will go with the short version. It’s a pretty awesome story. So if we ever cross paths and you want to hear the whole story just ask. I decided that I needed to learn how to code after a conversation I had with a tech recruiter.  After that conversation I started to play around with some of the online resources and began to read up on the different languages.  I discover ACLTC Dev Bootcamp after reading an article on builtinchicago.com. I got in contact with Jay the creator of the bootcamp and after our conversation I knew this is where I need to be. I quit my full time job at [Apple Vacation](http://www.applevacations.com) two weeks into the program. I knew that if I was going to learn to code, it would require a lot more of my attention. So far it has been one of the best decision I have ever made.  

The class has been great and I’ve learned so much. The main focus has been Ruby on Rails, which has been a lot of fun. We’ve learned so much from creating application, to creating API’s and webclients. We have also learned some html, css and worked with Bootstrap. We are currently learning JavaScript which a completely new beast. So far it has been an incredible journey.

The class is only the first part of my journey. My goal is to one day change the way people live their lives for the better. There is so much capacity for positive change around us. By knowing how to code, I believe I will have the tools to make the world a better place.  That is the destination and in this blog I hope to chronicle my journey to achieve that goal.  Thanks for joining me on my journey. This should be fun!
